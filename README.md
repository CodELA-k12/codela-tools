# Codela
 
(*Code for the ELA classroom*)

**Codela** is a basic coding tool designed to help students learn to work with code in the English Language Arts (ELA) classroom. This low-floor, high-ceiling, open-source multimodal tool encourages students to develop coding literacy, computational thinking, and computer science knowledge.  We strive for a highly usable and accessible design with clearly written ReadMe documentation and code comments.

ALL contents may be adapted for your own institution, its purposes, and students. To get started at your institution, follow the instructions below:

1. Create and account or sign in to **GitHub**
2. In the upper right-hand corner, click on your user icon and go to "My Organizations."
3. Create a "New Organization."
4. Go to the top of this repository and select "Fork" or "Create a new fork." 
5. Change the "owner" to your new organization.
6. Rename the repository to align with your institution.
7. Select the green "Create Fork" button. Awesome! Now you have your own fork of Codela. Forking allows others in our open-source community to follow and access your work, just as you have benefitted from this repository.
8. [Go to the Codela organization page](https://github.com/orgs/codela-k12/repositories) to fork any and all repositories you desire. 
9. Do the work of adapting content to your institution. Don't forget to change ALL links to keep users within your own organization.
10. Now go share the magic...actually, it's computer science!
