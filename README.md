# Open Fuego Coding Tools
 
Open Fuego is a basic coding tool designed to help students learn to work with code. This low-floor, high-ceiling, open-source multimodal tool encourages students to develop coding literacy, computational thinking, and computer science knowledge.  We strive for a highly usable and accessible design with clearly written ReadMe documentation and code comments.

ALL contents may be adapted for your own institution, its purposes, and students. For an example, [open Pitt Fuego.](https://pitt-fuego.github.io/Pitt-Fuego-Coding-Tools/). To get started at your institution, follow the instructions below. 

1. Sign into GitHub
2. In the upper right-hand corner, click on your icon and go to "My Organizations."
3. Create a "New Organization."
4. Go to the top of this repository and select "Fork" or "Create a new fork" 
5. Change the owner to your new organization.
6. Rename your repository to align with your institution.
7. Select the green "Create Fork" button. Awesome! Now you have your own fork. Forking allows others in our Open-source community to follow and access your work.
