# Pitt Fuego Coding Tools


 
###We need a simple method to help students to learn to work with code. This low floor, high ceiling, open-source multimodal tool helps students learn to do just this--one that can keep up with the aesthetics of Adobe Spark Post, but a program whose functions, affordances, and constraints may be controlled by the user. I have also designed several iterations of this tool and used them in different classes for a variety of multimodal purposes. My students and colleagues have also adapted this tool to make new tools, presentations, and web portfolios. I encourage you to do the same. 

###The program is called the “Pitt Fuego” in honor of the place and the students where I teach, but the title may be adapted for your own institution and its own purposes (GIT HUB ADDRESS). The tool allows the user to build web pages quickly by working through the code. All of the instructions and prompts to do so are embedded in code itself, and all of the CSS functions have been standardized to run across coding tools. Once students learn the basics, they can find a repository of code functions within the document, cut and paste what they want, and manipulate the content and coding functions to their desires. Then, using their own GitHub account, students can upload and commit their files to a project repository and publish their page to the internet. Similarly, students can publish their work to university servers.  The projects templates and the code that resides within allowS for a craft-based activity that returns the learner to the place of becoming, the place in which the learner might fundamentally change how they think and even interact with the other.
