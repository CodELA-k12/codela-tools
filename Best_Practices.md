PITT FUEGO BEST PRACTICES

Work with Code – most all of the code your students will need to write has already been written. Encourage students to work with code, not write it. (Disagree? See our final entry)

Admit ignorance – your students will be much more responsive to learning about code and computer science when they realize that their teachers are also learners.  

Be flexible – there are many solutions to any given problem. Use difference as an opportunity to engage learning, asking questions, and assessing quality in different circumstances.    

Don’t fix things for your students – teach students to learn how to learn by directing them to the right resources.

Promote online learning spaces – most of the questions and answers we seek have already been discussed somewhere on the internet. Encourage students to discover and contribute to these spaces on sites like GitHub and Stack Overflow, and to use other learning spaces like W3. 
 
Leverage classroom knowledge – acknowledging your own limitations will encourage students who may possess more knowledge than you to speak up and take leadership roles. 

Set Deadlines, but be flexible – give your students all the time they need to figure out how to work with code. Demand excellence, but ensure learning. 

Think Small Groups – small groups provide a great way to help students learn to connect with the other through code. 

Debugging Sessions – students will often arrive to class with big problems that require simple solutions. Allow students time to meet in small groups to solve their coding problems. 

Small Group Presentations - presenting work in small groups takes the pressure off of presenting in larger ones. They also allow students to ask more questions and learn more about their own learning. 

Group Share - After small group presentations, require each group to share-out the highlights of their experience, not only sharing what they made, but what they learned. 

Build Confidence – Be proud of your students! Encourage them to continue working with code and learning new technologies. 

Promote Transfer - Offer plenty of time for students to assess what they learned and to process how they learned it. Focus on aspects of rhetoric, writing, and computational thinking.

Promote Other Kinds of Coding Experience – It may be unrealistic to learn more than Pitt Fuego in your classroom, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t encourage students to transfer their new knowledge and skills to learn more about code, even learning how to write their own.    



SAMPLE TEACHING CYCLE (3 projects)

-Classroom/Code Icebreaker
Start your class with code. Combine the standard introduction with code, presenting who they are, where they came from, and where they want to go.  (see: Electrate Fuego or I AM; A Project in Becoming.)

-Stasis Theory Project
Students will work with code to figure out what they want to write or what they want to make by constructing a question, conjecture, definition, quality, and policy. (see: Stasis Theory Machine, Elevator Pitch Generator)

-Multimodal Communication Document
Students will use the tools in Pitt Fuego to make a mobile-ready multimodal communication document. (See Pitt Fuego or any of our other Presentation Methods)



FAQ

Q: How do I get started teaching students to work with code? 

A: Start with our introductory programs, Electrate Fuego or I AM; A project in becoming. 

Q: Wait a minute! What about me? How do I get started learning to work with code?

A: The same way silly! But YOU should get started working with code before you facilitate these lessons in your class. Get to know your code editor. Get to know the affinity spaces to which you will be sending your students for answers. Share your own work - even your own problems and frustrations – with your students. 

Q: Where are the directions?

A: They are embedded in the code. Teach students to use a code editor to open the index.html fime and style.css file to find the directions. 

Q: Can my students really figure out how to work with code?

A: If you and your students can’t figure out Pitt Fuego, then WE have a problem. Please let us know. 

Q: How do I assess this?

A: Set expectations: demand students work with code to meet specific requirements and goals for content, usability, and aesthetics, but assess actual learning, presentation, and participation rather than product. 

Q: What if a student already knows everything there is to know about .HTML and .CSS?

A:  No problem. Pitt Fuego is only a multimodal communication tool. While we can use the code to help us arrange, style, and circulate our content, we still need to invent content and connect with our audience. 

Q: What is computational thinking? 

A: Computational thinking includes aspects of pattern recognition, algorithmic thinking, decomposition, and abstraction. While experts have argued that writing code is not the same thing as computational thinking, the process can be…if we encourage our students to focus on aspects of computational thinking throughout our praxis.
